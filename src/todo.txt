-	coordinate ReplicatedDB and Paxos commits

-	commit and non-commit rounds:
	1. First I thought I can add a special commit flag to the messages, so
	some messages can be tagged to be commited, which would trigger the
	commit of previous in-memory rounds as soon as the acceptor receives
	a message flagged; however, what if the proposer looses out and some
	other proposers non-commit proposal wins out --- this would result in
	some nodes having commited, possibly a majority not commiting,
	violating the fundamental Paxos invariant.
	2. How about special commit values? This doesn't work either.
	
	the only way out seems to be to use TCP!
