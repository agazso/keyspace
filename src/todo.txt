proposers should be learners

if it received a learn message, it will stop proposing and stop accepting proposals

the ReplicatedLog will override this and notify the ReplicatedDB and in a transaction
set the initial state for the next paxos round, then actually change the in-memory
paxos state of the acceptor, proposer and learner



proposers must guarantee the ballot numbers are unique:

<incrementor, 40 bits> <nodeID, 8 bits> <restart counter, 16 bits>
