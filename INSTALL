Preliminaries (IMPORTANT, READ THIS!)
=====================================

Keyspace nodes need to have their system clocks synchronized to
within 1 second. This is fairly easy to accomplish using the
Network Time Protocol, more specifically the NTP daemon,
which comes standard with most UNIX-like distributions.
See 'man ntpd'.



Building Keyspace
=================

In order to build Keyspace, you will need the following libraries:
- BerkeleyDB C++ library (libdb4.4++-dev)

To build Keyspace, type 'make'.

This will create the Keyspace binary 'keyspace' in the 'bin' folder.



Running Keyspace
================

To launch the Keyspace, start it with the included safe script
which can be found at script/safe_keyspace.

Usage:

	script/safe_keyspace [binary-file] [config-file]

E.g.

	script/safe_keyspace bin/keyspace test/0/keyspace.conf


If you want to run more than one instances:

	script/safe_keyspace bin/keyspace test/1/keyspace.conf
	script/safe_keyspace bin/keyspace test/2/keyspace.conf
	

Configuration options
=====================

- paxos.endpoints

	This must be the same on all nodes. These values define a Paxos ring.

	The nodes use 3 consecutive port numbers for Paxos related protocols,
	starting with the values defined here. (These are different than the
	ports you define below such as http.port)

- paxos.nodeID
	
	This must be different on all nodes. The first node's ID is 0, the
	seconds' is 1 and so on.

- database.dir

	The directory where the BerkeleyDB files are stored. If you run 
	multiple instances on the same host, this must be different for all nodes.

- database.type

	Currently unused.

- http.port

	The port of the Keyspace HTTP server.  If you run  multiple instances 
	on the same host, this must be different for all nodes.

- memcached.port

	The port of the Memcached server. Currently unused.

- keyspace.port

	The port of the Keyspace protocol. If you run  multiple instances 
	on the same host, this must be different for all nodes.
